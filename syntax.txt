$a[b,c]{d} - function called "a" with arguments "b" and "c" has code "d"
a[b,c]       - calls function "a"
*[a]{b}      - runs b a times (square brackets are optional) ("_" will be the index of the loop, as a list if there are multiple nested loops)
*?[?+]{a}   - while loop (this one will run "a" forever)
?a=a{}          - if statement (evaluates to true in this case) (can also use square brackets around a=a)
!?a=a{}         - else if
!!a=a{}         - else

assigning variables:
int: 0>a
str: "hello">b
bool: ?+>c
list: ,[0,1,2]>d

multiple: anything > c, d

get list index: 
d[1] -> 1
d[0] -> 0
d[-1] -> 2

MACROS!

(used with $)

$s[list] - gives the sum of a list

can use numbers with e syntax
ex:

1000 = 1e3
4500000 = 45e5
